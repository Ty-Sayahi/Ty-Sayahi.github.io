Hi, I'm Ty, a kid in Ohio who likes messing around with electronics. This website will become my portfolio in the future.

### Education & Experience

I currently attend Nagel Middle School, a suburban school that has given me lots of great opportunities including:
- A graphic design course that teaches us how to create nice designs.
- A sculpture course that teaches us the basics of sculpting from clay.

Thats pretty much it. I am currently trying to learn programming, but I dont even know the basics yet.
