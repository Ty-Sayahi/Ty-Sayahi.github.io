### About Me
I believe that you should strive to be a good person. 

### Creativity
Embedded below is a project I did. It was about the differences between an artisan and ancient Florence and an artisan in ancient Japan. I enjoyed this project because I liked writing and researching the script. I enjoyed animating the whole thing, and I enjoyed working with my group to present it. I know it isn't that high quality, but I still enjoyed creating it. I think this is creative because writing the script needed creativity, and animating it needed creativity. I also had to be creative to make the setting plausible and fit into the time period this took place in.

### Critical Thinking
Below is a picture of my computer. I custom built this computer myself, and I have modified it heavily. This all required critical thinking on my part in order to achieve.
