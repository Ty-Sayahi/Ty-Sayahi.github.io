### About Me
I believe that you should strive to be a good person. 

### Creativity
Embedded below is a project I did. It was about the differences between an artisan and ancient Florence and an artisan in ancient Japan. I enjoyed this project because I liked writing and researching the script. I enjoyed animating the whole thing, and I enjoyed working with my group to present it. I know it isn't that high quality, but I still enjoyed creating it. I think this is creative because writing the script needed creativity, and animating it needed creativity. I also had to be creative to make the setting plausible and fit into the time period this took place in.

This project is currently not done due to the fact that a cat peed in a critical, expensive part we need, but we can still talk about it. Carson, Will, and My projects were meant to see whether a ecosystem 100% separated from the outside with a vacuum would survive. Unfortunately it is not done due to the fact that the pump is destroyed, but we still might get it done with a really cheap replacement part. We chose this topic because it seemed like a fun idea that also answered a few interesting research questions. Thats really it.


### Collaboration
Attached below is a project I made with my friend, Jesse. (At the time of writing only the script is done, so I will link that.)
The project was about the 2018 california wildfires. It starts robot John Oliver, on a quest to find out why the fires happened, and how to fight them. I really enjoyed making this project, because working with Jesse allowed us to both share our ideas and speed up the writing process. Also, getting to write a semi-comedic piece for school was really fun.

### Communication

### Critical Thinking
Below is a picture of my computer. I custom built this computer myself, and I have modified it heavily. This all required critical thinking on my part in order to achieve.
