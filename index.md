### Creativity

This project is currently not done due to the fact that a cat peed in a critical, expensive part we need, but we can still talk about it. Carson, Will, and My projects were meant to see whether a ecosystem 100% separated from the outside with a vacuum would survive. Unfortunately it is not done due to the fact that the pump is destroyed, but we still might get it done with a really cheap replacement part. We chose this topic because it seemed like a fun idea that also answered a few interesting research questions. Thats really it.
